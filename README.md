# Introduction

[OpenData.sk initiative](http://opendata.sk) is, as part of our activities, among other things monitoring number of datasets (and some other metrics) on various Open Data catalogs (see [the data harvesting script](https://github.com/hanecak/data-catalog-stats) and [collected data](https://github.com/hanecak/data_data-catalog-stats)).

This project contains basic visualization for total dataset counts.

Suggestions, bug-reports and pull-request are welcome is the [issue tracker](https://github.com/hanecak/viz_data-catalog-stats_dataset_count/issues).
